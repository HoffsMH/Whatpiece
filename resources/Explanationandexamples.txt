ok so game
characters can equip items

slots bracer wrist
helm head

better items
bought with conq

seasons everyone starts a season with 0 conq points earned
players earn conquest points by playing games

weekly cap
it does not take the average player that long into the week to reach his weekly cap
if he is fairly active. usually the average player can get his cap in under a day

varies depending on rating
rating increases and decreases as you win and lose games ranked games
if you win more games vs better people you gain more rating than someone who does not.

example of website that converts rating to cap

rating only affect the cap of the following week

remember how there are different slots?
and how weapons increase effectivness

weapons most valuable item
they increase effectiveness  more than any other item

at the begining of a season everyone wants to get weapon as fast as they can

Weapons currently cost 3500

but you have to wait till you have earned 7250 season total to buy weapons. so you can't buy them immeadiately

generally the goal is to hit 3500 right as you hit

you might say why not just spend 3750 then start saving

7250 - 3500 = 3750

remember how i said the average player can get his cap in under a day?
usually players play for more than one day a week so if they have already reached their conquest for that week
then they are playing to try to increase their rating
remember a higher rating means a larger conquest cap next week.




run very standard simulation and show why its not as simple

I have 1800  Conquest Points.

I have earned 1800  of my 2200  weekly cap and  season total.

My Projected Conquest cap for next week is 2200 .



so lets say week 1:
we start off with 0 
2200 cap
we buy 1250 weapon
we have 950 left over

week 2:
we start this week with the 950
2200 cap
we have 3150 to spend
we buy 2250 piece
we have 900 left over

now if we wanted to get weapon the moment we hit 7250 conq pts season earned we would could not buy another item
because we have already bought 3500  and the remaining 3500 we are going to earn has to be saved for the weapon.
so lets talk about 2 different versions of the same following weeks



	heres the Dumb Version
	week 3:
	we start this week with the 900 from week 2
	2200 cap
	we dont spend any of it

	week 4:
	we start this week with 3100 from week 3
	2200 cap
	we have 5300 to spend 
	we buy our weapon for 3500
	we have 1800 left to spend that could have been spent the previous week and used 
	to make your character more effective
	which means you could have won more games
	which means you your rating could be higher


	heres the smart version
	week 3:
	we start this week with the 900 from week 2
	2200 cap
	we have 3100 to spend
	we buy a 1750 piece
	we have 1300 left over


	week 4:
	we start this week with 1350 from week 3
	2200 cap
	3550 to spend on weapon that cost 3500

You still get your item the same week but you had more opportunity to push rating before you got your weapons 
and equal opportunity to push rating after you got your weapons

catchup cap?

this problem is a rephrasing of an old programing problem called the knapsack problem

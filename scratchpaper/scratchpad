armed with the knowledge of how much we want to save on average and thus
how much we want to spend on average also armed with the knowledge of how many conquest points are available to us in a given week
also armed with how much actual room to spend we have. 
We can come up with an item to reccomend for each given week

but there is still the problem of the first week



we perform a nuber of calculations

we calculate whether or not with that weeks current supply of conquest points  can be spent on the item

can we afford it?

we calculate the remainder after buying this item and seeing if the difference between this items remainder and our average wanted remainder is less than the same difference for any of the other 2 items.

how close is its fit?


how big of a deficit could you create with the current system?
